## Data

The data used in the application is downloaded from [mockaroo.com](https://www.mockaroo.com/). Mockaroo is a free test data generator website. It is used to generate realistic test data. The data is stored locally, in a JSON object in the `assets` folder, in a file named `Data.js`.

## Page Speed and Load Time

To evaluate the performance of this web application, I utilized Google Lighthouse, a comprehensive tool for auditing the quality of web pages. This tool was instrumental in providing insights into the page speed and load times of this application.
The analysis included measurements of key performance indicators such as

- First Contentful Paint,
- Largest Contentful Paint,
- Total Blocking Time,
- Cumulative Layout Shift, and
- Speed Index.

For page loading time of this application, I have used the `First Contentful Paint (FCP)` and `Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)` metrics. These two are the most directly relevant to how quickly the page's content becomes visible to the user, which is what most people consider as "loading time".

The results of the analysis are as follows:

- Homepage load time and performance <strong>`FCP: 0.6s`, `LCP: 0.6s`</strong>:

- Editor page load time and performance <strong>`FCP: 0.6s`, `LCP: 0.6s`</strong>:
